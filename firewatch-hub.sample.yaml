# Sample configration file
# ========================

# All paths are relative to location of the configuration file - for example
# if the configuration file is "/some/conf/foo.yaml" then
# "ca_cert_file: some/cert" translates to "/some/conf/some/cert" and
# "ca_cert_file: ../some/cert" translates to "/some/some/cert" but
# "ca_cert_file: /some/cert" translates to "/some/cert".
